            <p>I&apos;m a software developer with 4 years of experience. I mainly use the Typescript with the React ecosystem (React, React Native and Express.js), but have also learnt and used other languages such as: Angular, C#, Spring Boot, Python and HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

            I used to study creative writing in Singapore Polytechnic but switched courses after finding finding out that writing was not what I wanted to do long-term. I chose Information Technology because I was drawn to the idea of creating things from nothing.

            With programming, you could build whatever you envisioned and it would all happen in real-time. the feedback loop was short, and learning programming was an enjoyable process. 
            To me, programming was a lot like writing, whatever creative ideas you penned down would come true, only that coding had a more tangible effect.

                I&rsquo;ve also always been a hands-on learner, absorbing more knowledge faster as I apply what I learn into real life. So being able to try out wacky ideas has immensely helped me grasp the handles on certain abstract concepts.

            <p>It&rsquo;s only after I became better at programming could I actually help others with my skills. It could be tackling real-world problems, building websites for others or even fixing computer issues, I could do so much more than before.</p>
