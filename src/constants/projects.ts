        `GoLunch was my final-year project, done in July 2019. It was a special project not only because it was my first client project, but because this was a first-ever joint-collaboration between Singapore Polytechnic and theFIRMA, a university based in Finland. The projectâ€™s client was Kupittaan Paviljonki, a Finland-based restaurant, and they wanted a web-based tracking app that customers could access anywhere and track the distance walked to and fro their restaurants to provide discounts for customers. <br/><br/>
        We used web3.js to store the distance tracked, and perform transactions whenever the user gains more points, or decides to redeem his points. This was also a submission for PolyFintech100 API Hackathon.
        <h3 class="section-header">Challenges</h3>
        This was a challenging project to tackle due to the vague requirements and nature of project. The client requested for mobile features, but wished for the product to be a Progressive Web App (PWA). Additionally, due to the difference in timezones between Finland and Singapore, we rarely could find a suitable time for both parties to discuss. So even if we had questions, we had to wait them off until we could talk to the client, and this lead to wasted effort and time working on features that the client did not wish for.

        Makes all timings local. Simply click on the Timezonify button after opening the extension popup and Voila. 
        You can also convert timezones using the popup window without having to Google it. Part of my motivation creating this was because I was quite sick of having to Google the relation of foreign timezones to my own and I thought it would be good to have a web extension automate that for me.
        
        <h3 class="section-header">Challenges</h3>
        The main challenges came from learning the web extension capabilities, how to pass and persist data, and how to find and convert timezones. My original idea was to have a one-click button which converted all timezones automatically into your own. So I started off using regex to match timezones, however, I came across very odd HTML formatting which made it unfeasible to have the one-click button. So I moved to selections, which auto-selects valid timezones when the user selects some text, and overlays a popup above which when clicked, would overlay the original timezone with your local timezone. 
        I had to work with Selection and Range API, and ensuring that the overlay would be positioned snugly on the original text. However, even this too proved unfeasible as sometimes the local timezone overlay would extend beyond the original text length and cover text after it. And unfortunately for me, this was discovered only after weeks of work and effort put into learning Selections and Ranges and implementing the idea
        <br/><br/>
        In the end, I decided that my original idea wasn't so bad after all: a button which when clicked would use regex to find and convert all valid timezones into local timezones. For those timezones which could not be caught during the initial regex search, there is a timezone converter built into the web extension itself, which allows the user to manually convert timezones into their own timezone.

    description: {__html:`
        Mowbray Counter was created due to me wanting to count the number of times I visited Mowbray Camp. I used PyTelegramBotAPI and PostgreSQL to create the chatbot, and Heroku to deploy the chatbot. 
        I wanted my users to be able to click on a "Check In", and they would automatically fill in a contact tracing form using data already configured by them and record the visit in the database once done. I looked into Webcrawlers and Web Automation for this, but soon realised that this was not feasible as the ArmyDeclare page not only used WebForms, which made it quite impossible for me to send an API request to the WebForms, but also that they used Captcha, which mean I could not automate form-filling.
        After a period of tinkering, I settled for the more simplistic approach, and gave the users the link to ArmyDeclare when they first start the bot, and the option to record their visit afterwards.
        As I wanted this bot to be ready 24/7, I looked into deploying chatbots on Heroku using webhooks. As I was not very experience with hosting projects, I found it challenging to get the chatbot to get it in working condition. Whether it be due to incorrect Heroku configurations, errors in the code, the bot going inactive or whether the bot simply did not want to respond, it was a tedious, but necessary process. And when I finally managed to get my chatbot working, I was satisfied. It worked without errors and was available 24/7. 
        You can try the bot in Telegram: @mowbraycounter_bot
