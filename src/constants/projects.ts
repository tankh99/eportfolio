        Eye Want to Rest helps your eyes work the way it's intended to. Eye Want to Rest gives your eyes the time to rest it needs from looking at our screens all day long and reduces occurrence of dry eyes

        <h3 class="section-header">Inspiration</h3>
        I built Eye Want to Rest initially as part of a submission for a hackathon. Because my work requires me to look at the screen throughout the entire day, I suffered from quite a bit of productivity loss when I experienced migraines or dry eyes from my eyes bring strained too much. 
        However, this project seemed small and simple, yet worthwhile and meaningful enough for me to expand upon it further after the hackathon and submit it onto the App Store and Play Store.
        While building upon the application, I used it on myself and found that I could work for longer hours and actually felt more refreshed as long as I had breaks in between my work hours. I felt empowered and motivated to see this application through to the end.

        This was my final-year project, done in July 2019. It was a special project to me not only because it was my first actual client project, but because this was a first-ever joint-collaboration between Singapore Polytechnic and theFIRMA, a university based in Finland. The projectâ€™s client was Kupittaan Paviljonki, a Finland-based restaurant, and they wanted a web-based tracking app that customers could access anywhere and track the distance walked to and fro their restaurants to provide discounts for customers. <br/><br/>
        We used web3.js to store the distance tracked, and perform transactions whenever the user gains more points, or decides to redeem his points.

        This was a challenging project to tackle due to the vague requirements and nature of project. The client requested for mobile features, but wished for the product to be a PWA. Additionally, due to the difference in timezones between Finland and Singapore, we rarely could find a suitable time for both parties to discuss. So even if we had questions, we had to wait them off until we could talk to the client, and this lead to wasted effort and time working on features that the client did not wish for.

        AIvin is a simple chatbot built with Expo created for the 48-hours SupriseHacks 2021 Competition. By conversing with AIvin, you get to hear a few random
        quips and quotes from. However, that didn't interest me enough, so I added a poke button, which would irritate him and cause him to spew out insults.
        I always had a love of planting easter eggs into seemingly normal programs, so this poke button would eventuall trigger a special scene which would 
        hijack the phone as a result of AIvin reaching peak irritation.

        <h3 class="section-header">Challenges</h3>
        The chat interface uses react-native-gifted-chat to send and receive messages to and from the user, and it was for the most part, simple.
        The difficult part, however, lay in implemting the Call Screen. I had to very closely imitate iPhone's actual call screen, positioning the elements just nicely and ensuring every colour had the right tinge.
        Not only that, I had to ensure that text-to-speech was timed properly and that AIvin would respond accordingly when the user tapped on the End Call button.

        <h3 class="section-header">Motivation</h3>
        I created Timezonify because I often participated in virtual hackathons in 2021, and there were a lot of different timezones which I had to consistently convert. 
        
        Timezonify was created as a means to make the process of frequent timezone conversion more convenient since you wouldn't need to Google it each and every time.
        
        I decided on a web extension because it would be good exposure for me to publish something too

        <h3 class="section-header">Challenges</h3>
        At frist, I struggled with learning the web extension capabilities, of which, there wasn't too much help on forum for since extension development is relatively obscure. I relied on Firefox tutorials and Github code examples mainly to build what I wanted. 
        
        The initial idea for the extension had the user press a 'Timezonify' button where it would then automatically converted all foreign timezones into their local counterparts, according to the client's current timezone. 
        
        However, this proved to be inefficient and ineffective in certain edge ccases due to HTML parsing being quite unreliable given the way some websites format their HTML. 

        Then I moved on to user selection and highlighting. The user would highlight the timezone he or she wanted to convert, and if a valid timezone was located within the highlighted text, a 'Timezonify' popup would appear boave the highlighted text. click on that would overlay the original text with the converted time and timezone.

        Once again, however, this process was much too tedious and cumbersome than I originally envisioned the extension to be.

        Eventually, I relied the simple functionality of choosing countries and converting between timezones accordingly.

        This proved to be a much simpler and effective method that works for all cases. It's currently published on both the Chrome Extension Store and Firefox Extension Hub.

        Mowbray Counter was created due to me wanting to count the number of times I visited Mowbray Camp. I used PyTelegramBotAPI and PostgreSQL to create the chatbot, and Heroku to deploy the chatbot. 
        I wanted my users to be able to click on a "Check In", and they would automatically fill in a contact tracing form using data already configured by them and record the visit in the database once done. I looked into Webcrawlers and Web Automation for this, but soon realised that this was not feasible as the ArmyDeclare page not only used WebForms, which made it quite impossible for me to send an API request to the WebForms, but also that they used Captcha, which mean I could not automate form-filling.
        After a period of tinkering, I settled for the more simplistic approach, and gave the users the link to ArmyDeclare when they first start the bot, and the option to record their visit afterwards.
        As I wanted this bot to be ready 24/7, I looked into deploying chatbots on Heroku using webhooks. As I was not very experience with hosting projects, I found it challenging to get the chatbot to get it in working condition. Whether it be due to incorrect Heroku configurations, errors in the code, the bot going inactive or whether the bot simply did not want to respond, it was a tedious, but necessary process. And when I finally managed to get my chatbot working, I was satisfied. It worked without errors and was available 24/7.
