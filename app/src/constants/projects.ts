With GitHub's project management system, we balanced our workload using SCRUM framework.

        The project was initially a 2-month project and had workflows included in its project specifications, however, was cut down so that we could help work on applications that CSIT were currently using. We consistently engaged in discussions improve on certain features and consulted our mentor on topics we were unsure of.`
